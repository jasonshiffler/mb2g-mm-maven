This is a sample Maven project that demonstrates the multi-module capabilities of Maven. The pom.xml in the top level directory is the parent pom and those poms in sub directories are child poms. The parent pom defines the different modules. Some of the modules are dependencies of other modules and the necessary modules are defined as dependencies. Maven Reactor determines the appropriate build order based on which modules are dependent on one another. The parent pom also has an example of Maven enforcer which in this case is being used to set minimum requirements for Maven and Java.
